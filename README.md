# Notes from Generative AI with LLM course
This repository covers all the concepts from the Deeplearning.ai course: Generative AI with LLM. The repository contains explanations and summaries of various concepts in text, and the codes are stored in Jupyter notebooks. All the text notebooks are named **NB_xx** where xx indicates the number of that notebook. I would highly recommend following the notebooks in the order they are numbered. Additionally, all the notebooks have an index, so you can take a sneak peek into topics you wanna read. 

All the codebooks are named **CB__xx** and are complementary to the notebooks. I will cross-reference the notebooks and codebooks so that it's easier to follow along. 

## All the Notebooks 

1. NB00: Intro to LLMs
2. NB01: Transformer Architecture
3. NB02: Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning

## Index of codebooks
