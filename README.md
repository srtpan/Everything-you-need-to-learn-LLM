# Learn-LLM-
This repository covers all the concepts you will need to learn LLM, along with coding practice. The repository contains explanations and summaries of various concepts in text, and the codes are stored in Jupyter notebooks. All the text notebooks are named **NB_xx** where xx indicates the number of that notebook. I would highly recommend following the notebooks in the order they are numbered. Additionally, all the notebooks have an index, so you can take a sneak peek into topics you wanna read. 

All the codebooks are named **CB__xx** and are complementary to the notebooks. I will cross-reference the notebooks and codebooks so that it's easier to follow along. 

## All the Notebooks 

1. NB00: Intro to LLMs
2. NB01: Transformer Architecture
3. NB02: Prompt Engineering and In-Context Learning

## Index of codebooks
